### cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks by making escaped data 
There are three main types of XSS vulnerabilities:

- Persisted XSS - In this type of vulnerability, the source of unvalidated data comes from the database or Backend permanent store.
- Reflected (non-persistent) XSS - This type of vulnerability occurs when data provided by a web client is used immediately by server-side scripts to parse and display a page to a user without properly sanitizing the request.
- DOM XSS - For this vulnerability, the malicious data does not touch the web server. Rather, it is being reflected by the JavaScript code, fully on the client side.
