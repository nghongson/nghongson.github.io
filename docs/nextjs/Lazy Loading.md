[Lazy loading](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) in Next.js helps improve the initial loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of JavaScript needed to render a route.

There are two ways you can implement lazy loading in Next.js:

- Using Dynamic Imports with next/dynamic
- Using React.lazy() with Suspense
`next/dynamic`
