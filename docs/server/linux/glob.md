# Globbing in Linux
Globbing involves expanding a wildcard pattern such as * or ? into a list of pathnames that match a pattern.  
We use globbing with various commands such as rm, find, grep, ls, cat, cp to achieve a more desired result while executing these commands.  
Globbing is very useful in cases where we have scripts that interact with user input. A user's input might be vague and so we have to have measures that handle such cases. For example, if we expect the input to be a Yes, YES, Y we can use the asterisk glob to handle this.
## Asterisks (*).
## Question mark (?).
## Square brackets.
## Caret(^).
## Exclamation(!).
## Dollar sign($).
## Curly brackets {}.
## Pipes(|).
