# Asynchronous programming
Asynchronous programming is a crucial technique for developing high-performance and flexible applications. It allows us to write non-blocking and efficient code that can handle concurrent requests and improve the performance of our application.

In the asynchronous approach, tasks are executed independently and concurrently. This means that the program doesnâ€™t wait for a task to complete before moving on to the next one.

### Synchronous
- Pros: Easier to reason about, deterministic execution order, less complex error handling.
- Cons: Slower for long-running tasks, potentially slower overall execution time for multiple tasks.
### Asynchronous
- Pros: Faster for concurrent tasks, better performance, ideal for parallel processing.
- Cons: More complex error handling, potential race conditions if not managed properly.

Golang: 
Golang is achieved using Goroutines, which are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime.
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)
func task1() {
  time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
  fmt.Println("Task 1 completed.")
}

func task2() {
  time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
  fmt.Println("Task 2 completed.")
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Asynchronous Approach")
  start := time.Now()
  go task1()
  go task2()

  // Introduce a small sleep to allow Goroutines to execute
  time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
  elapsed := time.Since(start)
  fmt.Printf("Total execution time: %s\n", elapsed)
}
```
