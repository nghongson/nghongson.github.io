## Creational design patterns

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Object Pool
- Prototype
- Singleton

## Structural design patterns

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Private Class Data
- Proxy

## Behavioral design patterns

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

- Chain of responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Null Object
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template method
- Visitor
