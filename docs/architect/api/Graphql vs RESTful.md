# Whatâ€™s the Difference Between GraphQL and REST?


# The similarities between GraphQL and REST:
Both GraphQL and REST are popular API architecture styles that enable the exchange of data between different services or applications in a client-server model.
1. A client sends an API request to an endpoint or multiple endpoints on a server
2. The server gives a response that contains data, data status, or error codes
REST and GraphQL allow you to create, modify, update, and delete data on a separate application, service, or module via API.
