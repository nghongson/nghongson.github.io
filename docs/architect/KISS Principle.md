# K.I.S.S Principle

## KISS - Keep it simple stupid:  
Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than making them complex

## YAGNI - “You Aren’t Gonna Need It”:  
Coding some extra features “just in case we need them” or thinking“we will eventually need them”.  
“Do the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work”


## DRY - “Don’t Repeat Yourself”:  
The DRY principle, formulated by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer, states that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."  In other words, you must try to maintain the behavior of a functionality of the system in a single piece of code.
